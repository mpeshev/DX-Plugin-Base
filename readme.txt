It serves as a startup code providing reference and working codebase for:

* defining custom post types and taxonomies
* creating admin pages
* sample code of the Settings API implementation for admin pages
* registration of activate/deactivate hooks
* adding metaboxes on pages
* creating sample shortcode
* creating sample widget
* creating AJAX requests storing sample data in the database
* creating AJAX requests for fetching remote data with the HTTP API
* adding frontend styles/scripts the right way
* adding admin styles/scripts the right way
* defining common constants for further use

and more. **Use it freely as your plugin startup snippet**. 

Take the code as is for test and learning or use it when creating plugins for a solid base. To be extended with 
widget and shortcode samples.

== Installation ==

Upload the DX Plugin Base plugin to your blog and activate it. It would work as is.

Extend or comment whenever appropriate based on your assignment. 

== FAQ ==

= Is it compatible with latest WordPress? =

Yes, it is, as well as with the latest PHP. 

I've removed the 'pass-by-reference' call for all array( $this, ... ) entries as it's deprecated since 5.3.0. If you happen to use 5.2.4, you can replace all $this in arrays with &$this or better update PHP version.
